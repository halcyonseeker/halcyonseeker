Hi! My name is Thalia Wright, I'm a student at Reed College, an occasional programmer, and an aspiring fixer of the world's problems.

📫 **You can reach me at ...**

🔭 **I’m currently working on ...**
- [audible-dl](https://sr.ht/~thalia/audible-dl), a tool to manage offline, DRM-free, libraries of audiobooks sourced from Audible.com.
- [My dotfiles](https://git.sr.ht/~thalia/dotfiles), because the quest for perfection never ends.
- I'm starting to write a fully spec-compliant org-mode parser in C. In the medium term I'd like to implement a command line tool and accompanying library to make org-mode fully usable from outside of Emacs. In the long term I'm planning on building a user-friendly WYSIWYG word processor around this library with the aim of making the power of org-mode accessible to mere mortals. 

🌱 **I’m currently learning ...**
- Latin! Dead languages are the best.
- Russian, living languages are okay too.
- Lisp, the only programming language that is beautiful.
- Lex, a C metaprogram for generating lexical analysers.
- FreeBSD, a self-hoster's dream.
- Homesteading, because civilization will probably collapse by the end of the century.
- Motorcycle riding, because cars are boring and bicycles are slow.
- And much more ...
